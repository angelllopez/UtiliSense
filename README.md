# UtiliSense

- The project aims to develop a cloud-based software solution that can track and optimize the energy and water consumption of a private residence.
- The software will collect data from various sources, such as solar panels, smart meters, weather stations, and user inputs, and analyze them using machine learning algorithms and optimization models.
- The software will provide the user with real-time feedback, insights, and recommendations on how to reduce their environmental impact and save on utility bills, by adjusting their consumption patterns, switching to renewable energy sources, or investing in energy efficiency measures.
- The software will also enable the user to compare their performance with other similar residences and share their achievements and tips with a community of eco-conscious users.
- The project will contribute to the global efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainable development, by empowering individuals to take action and make informed decisions about their resource consumption.
